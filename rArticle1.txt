during
turkey’s
2018
presidential
election
campaign
the
new
york
times
ran
an
editorial
expressing
support
for
president
recep
tayyip
erdogan’s
opponent
at
the
time
muharrem
ince
after
a
few
paragraphs
it
was
clear
that
the
times
editorial
board
knew
that
it
disliked
erdogan
more
than
it
knew
about
ince
and
his
views
and
so
it
goes
with
kemal
kilicdaroglu
the
leader
of
the
republican
people’s
party
chp
and
a
sixparty
coalition’s
pick
to
challenge
erdogan
for
the
presidency
on
may
14
with
just
a
month
to
go
before
the
election
kilicdaroglu
is
up
by
between
7
and
10
points
yet
even
with
kilicdaroglu’s
commanding
lead
it
seems
hard
to
believe
that
erdogan
will
lose
this
is
perhaps
a
lack
of
imagination
but
he
has
been
in
power—first
as
prime
minister
and
then
as
president—since
2003
erdogan
and
his
justice
and
development
party
akp
have
hollowed
out
bent
and
fashioned
political
institutions
to
ensure
their
grip
on
power
the
turkish
president
has
used
the
apparatus
of
the
state
to
undermine
his
opponents
and
the
vast
majority
of
turkey’s
once
boisterous
if
not
always
responsible
media
can
now
be
relied
on
to
recite
the
government
line
the
judiciary
that
was
once
a
redoubt
of
the
secular
nationalist
establishment
is
now
the
preserve
of
akp
supporters
erdogan
has
remade
the
military
command
which
previously
was
loyal
only
to
the
principles
of
mustafa
kemal
ataturk
the
founder
of
modern
turkey
under
these
circumstances
it
seems
that
only
an
act
of
god
could
dislodge
erdogan
maybe
the
earthquake
on
feb
6
was
just
that
what
would
it
mean
for
turkish
politics
and
foreign
policy
if
kilicdaroglu
won
some
turkish
and
western
commentators
believe
turkey
can
once
again
be
democratic
prosperous
ready
to
pursue
membership
in
the
european
union
and
better
aligned
with
its
nato
allies
without
a
doubt
it
will
be
a
sigh
of
relief
for
millions
of
turks
if
erdogan
is
vanquished
and
relinquishes
his
office
but
it
is
unlikely
that
turkey
will
revert
to
a
past
that
never
existed
the
nation
alliance
also
known
as
the
“table
of
six”
that
kilicdaroglu
leads
is
an
ideologically
disparate
coalition
united
in
their
loathing
of
erdogan
in
addition
to
kilicdaroglu’s
chp
which
occupies
the
leftcentersocial
democrat
and
nationalist
space
the
alliance
includes
an
offshoot
of
turkey’s
hardright
nationalists
called
the
good
party
two
centerright
parties
led
by
akp
defectors
ali
babacan
and
ahmet
davutoglu
respectively
and
another
centerright
group
the
democrat
party
the
other
member
is
the
religious
nationalist
conservative
felicity
party
which
along
with
the
akp
was
established
in
2001
after
the
government
banned
another
islamist
party
making
fundamental
changes
to
turkey’s
political
institutions
will
not
be
as
easy
as
“urgently
implementing
…
constitutional
and
legislative
amendments”
as
kilicdaroglu
and
company
suggest
the
akp
has
had
20
years
to
abuse
turkey’s
political
institutions
for
its
benefit
having
captured
the
state
neither
the
party’s
leaders
nor
their
activists
throughout
the
bureaucracy
and
the
judiciary
are
likely
to
give
it
up
so
quickly
that
sets
up
the
country
for
a
titanic
struggle
in
which
either
the
nation
alliance
has
raised
expectations
too
high
forcing
it
to
back
off
and
pay
a
high
political
price
or
turkey’s
new
leaders
purge
akp
activists
within
the
government
in
order
to
smooth
the
transformation
the
alliance
seeks
these
outcomes
are
not
unprecedented
in
turkish
politics
in
recent
decades
turks
have
had
their
hopes
raised
about
eu
membership
and
in
particular
the
economy
only
to
have
their
hopes
dashed
the
latter
especially
sowed
political
instability
in
the
late
1990s
purges
have
now
become
a
feature
of
turkish
politics
in
february
1997
the
military
issued
“recommendations”
to
the
government
that
sought
the
purge
of
followers
of
one
of
the
akp’s
predecessor
parties
from
government
positions
and
there
has
been
an
ongoing
purge
since
2014
when
the
akp
began
cleansing
the
bureaucracy
of
its
erstwhile
partners
in
the
gulenist
or
hizmet
movement
