visitors
to
turkey
are
often
surprised
to
discover
that
in
a
country
supposedly
consumed
by
economic
malaise
the
restaurants
at
least
in
large
cities
are
bursting
with
customers
but
appearances
are
deceptive
a
big
reason
for
the
bustle
is
that
middleclass
turks
would
rather
spend
their
earnings
today
than
watch
inflation
officially
measured
at
55
year
on
year
but
widely
believed
to
be
much
higher
burn
through
their
savings
tomorrow
turkey’s
president
recep
tayyip
erdogan
has
bullied
the
central
bank
into
slashing
interest
rates
in
the
face
of
galloping
prices
allowing
the
lira
to
plummet
he
hoped
this
would
turbocharge
the
economy
by
making
exports
cheaper
and
encouraging
domestic
production
the
policy
mix
repackaged
as
turkey’s
“new
economic
programme”
would
bring
inflation
down
to
single
digits
ahead
of
this
year’s
presidential
and
parliamentary
elections
his
finance
minister
pledged
things
have
not
gone
according
to
plan
imports
remain
necessary
but
are
now
much
more
expensive
hence
they
have
dwarfed
exports
landing
turkey
with
its
biggest
absolute
currentaccount
deficit
in
four
decades
annual
inflation
has
dipped
from
85
last
year
but
remains
by
far
the
highest
in
the
oecd
a
group
of
mainly
rich
countries
growth
continues
thanks
less
to
exports
than
to
an
unsustainable
surge
in
consumption
mr
erdogan’s
economic
model
seems
to
have
run
its
course
the
poor
economy
compounded
by
the
earthquakes
that
killed
over
50000
people
in
the
country’s
south
in
february
has
darkened
mr
erdogan’s
prospects
opinion
polls
show
him
trailing
the
opposition’s
joint
candidate
for
president
kemal
kilicdaroglu
by
four
or
more
points
for
a
populist
strongman
who
enjoys
a
servile
news
media
and
control
over
the
country’s
institutions
that
is
hardly
insurmountable
but
it
is
the
biggest
hole
mr
erdogan
has
faced
before
any
major
election
how
he
plans
to
dig
himself
out
of
it
remains
unclear
the
elections
are
set
for
may
14th
with
a
runoff
on
may
28th
if
no
candidate
gets
an
absolute
majority
in
the
presidential
contest
more
tends
to
happen
in
turkey
in
two
months
than
in
most
countries
in
two
years
but
mr
erdogan
seems
to
be
running
out
of
ideas
especially
regarding
the
economy
sensing
a
historic
chance
the
opposition
is
closing
ranks
on
march
22nd
the
country’s
main
kurdish
party
said
it
would
not
as
had
been
feared
field
its
own
candidate
for
the
presidency
suggesting
it
would
endorse
mr
kilicdaroglu
and
avoid
splitting
the
opposition
vote
many
fear
that
mr
erdogan
may
revert
to
rabblerousing
one
option
may
be
a
renewed
confrontation
with
greece
over
maritime
borders
says
selim
koru
at
the
economic
policy
research
foundation
of
turkey
an
election
in
greece
also
now
expected
in
may
raises
the
risk
of
a
clash
of
words
or
at
worst
of
arms
domestic
politics
may
favour
hot
heads
over
cooler
ones
“i’m
not
sure
these
guys
will
go
quietly”
says
mr
koru
of
mr
erdogan
and
his
circle
when
it
comes
to
the
economy
the
turkish
leader’s
options
are
limited
over
the
past
three
months
the
government
has
raised
the
minimum
wage
by
55
more
than
doubled
the
basic
pension
and
passed
a
law
making
millions
of
turks
eligible
for
early
retirement
